Welcome to the Peabody Club! There is not much to see on this page right now, but be sure to check back for later changes. We are getting ready for our 
summer session! It will begin a little over five weeks from now! You will be able to access your schedules online this year, through an account. Accounts
will start off being issued by person, but in the future online sign-ups will be available. Along with schedules, a list of books, accomplishments and "grades" 
will be posted under your account. Thanks to the meteorologists in our club, you will have access to daily weather reports.
