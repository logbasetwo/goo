<h1>Sign up for the Google AJAX Search API</h1>

<p>The Google AJAX Search API lets you embed Google Search in your personal web pages.
A single AJAX Search API key is valid within a single directory on your web server, including any subdirectories.
Signing up the URL <code>http://www.mygooglesearchssite.com/mysite</code>, for example, will create a key usable within
all URLs in the <code>http://www.mygooglesearchssite.com/mysite/</code> directory.
See the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/documentation/">API documentation</a> for more information.
You must have a <a href="http://www.google.com/accounts/">Google Account</a>
to obtain a Google API key, and your API key is tied directly to your
Google Account. You can generate multiple API keys for your account if
you have multiple web sites.</p>

<p>Here are some highlights from the terms of use for those of you who aren't lawyers (but be sure to read the entire document):</p>

<ul style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
  <li>Your web site must be freely accessible to end users.</li>
  <li>Google
will upgrade this API periodically, and you must update your site to
use new versions of the API as they become available. The Google AJAX
Search API team will post notifications of updates on the <a href="http://googleajaxsearchapi.blogspot.com/"> Google AJAX Search API Blog</a>.
If we make a change that isn't backwards-compatible, we will give you
at least a reasonable amount of time to make the transition; during
this period both versions of the API will be supported. Please
transition your code as soon as possible to avoid interruptions in your
service.</li>
</ul>

Google AJAX Search API Terms of Use
Thank you for using the Google AJAX Search API. By using the Google
AJAX Search API (the "Service"), you ("You") accept and agree to be
bound by the following terms and conditions (the "Terms of Use"). In
addition, if your use of the Google AJAX Search API incorporates images
or data from the Google Maps service, you agree to be bound by the
Google Maps Terms of Use.
1. Service.
1.1 Description of Service. The API consists of Javascript that allows
You to display results from Google searches, including text and URL
results from Google Web Search and results from searches on other
Google services ("Google Search Results") on your website, subject to
the limitations and conditions described below. The API is limited to
allowing You to host and display Google Search Results on your site,
and does not provide You with the ability to access other underlying
Google Services or data.
Subject to the limitations and conditions described below, You may use
the API to enable end users of your site to designate Google Search
Results for you to host and display in conjunction with other
information that they upload or post to your site. The API may be used
only for services that are accessible to your end users without charge.
In order to obtain the API, You must have a Google Account. After
supplying Google with Your account information, the URL of your
service, and agreeing to the Terms of Use, You will be issued an
alphanumeric key assigned to You by Google that is uniquely associated
with your Google Account and the URL of your service. Your service must
import the Google AJAX Search API using an HTML &lt;script&gt; tag that
contains this key, as described in the Google AJAX Search API
documentation, and Google will block requests with an invalid key or
invalid URL.
1.2 Modifications. Google reserves the right to release subsequent
versions of the API and to require You to obtain and use the most
recent version. Google may modify the Terms of Use at any time with or
without notice, and You can review the most current version of the
Terms of Use online at any time at
http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/terms.html, or such future URL
as Google may designate. If a modification is unacceptable to You, You
may cancel the Service by removing the Javascript from Your Site. If
You continue to use the Service on any Site, You will be deemed to have
accepted the modifications.
1.3 Appropriate Conduct and Prohibited Uses. The Service may be used
only for services that are accessible to your end users without charge.
You agree that you will not, and you will not permit your users or
other third parties to: (a) modify or replace the text, images, or
other content of the Google Search Results; or (b) modify, replace or
otherwise disable the functioning of links to Google or third party
websites provided in the Google Search Results.
You agree that You are responsible for your own conduct and content
while using the Service and for any consequences thereof. You agree to
use the Service only for purposes that are legal, proper and in
accordance with these Terms of Use and any applicable policies or
guidelines. By way of example, and not as a limitation, You agree that
when using the Service, You will not, and will not permit your end
users or other third parties to:
o defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or otherwise violate the legal
rights (such as rights of privacy and publicity) of others;
o upload, post, email or transmit or otherwise make available any
inappropriate, defamatory, infringing, obscene, or unlawful Content;
o upload, post, email or transmit or otherwise make available any
Content that infringes any patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret
or other proprietary right of any party, unless You (or the end user
posting the Content) are the owner of the Rights or have the permission
of the owner to post such Content;
o upload, post, email or transmit or otherwise make available messages
that promote pyramid schemes, chain letters or disruptive commercial
messages or advertisements,
or anything else prohibited by law, these Terms of Service or any
applicable policies or guidelines.
o distribute any file posted by another that You know, or reasonably
should know, that cannot be legally distributed in such manner;
o impersonate another person or entity, or falsify or delete any author
attributions, legal or other proper notices or proprietary designations
or labels of the origin or source of software or other material;
o restrict or inhibit any other user from using and enjoying Google
services;
o use Google services for any illegal or unauthorized purpose;
o remove any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notices
contained in or on Google services;
o interfere with or disrupt Google services or servers or networks
connected to Google services, or disobey any requirements, procedures,
policies or regulations of networks connected to Google services;
o use any robot, spider, site search/retrieval application, or other
device to retrieve or index any portion of Google services or collect
information about users for any unauthorized purpose;
o submit Content that falsely expresses or implies that such Content is
sponsored or endorsed by Google;
o create user accounts by automated means or under false or fraudulent
pretenses;
o promote or provide instructional information about illegal activities
or promote physical harm or injury against any group or individual;
o incorporate Google Search Results as the primary content on your
website or page; or
o transmit any viruses, worms, defects, Trojan horses, or any items of
a destructive nature.
International users agree to comply with their own local rules
regarding online conduct and acceptable content, including laws
regulating the export of data to the United States or your country of
residence.
1.4 Advertising. Google reserves the right to include advertising in
the Google Search Results provided to You through the Service.
2. Proprietary Rights.
2.1 Google Rights. For purposes of the Terms of Use, "Intellectual
Property Rights" shall mean any and all rights existing from time to
time under patent law, copyright law, semiconductor chip protection
law, moral rights law, trade secret law, trademark law, unfair
competition law, publicity rights law, privacy rights law, and any and
all other proprietary rights, and any and all applications, renewals,
extensions and restorations thereof, now or hereafter in force and
effect worldwide. As between You and Google, You acknowledge that
Google owns all right, title and interest, including without limitation
all Intellectual Property Rights, in and to the Service and that You
shall not acquire any right, title, or interest in or to the Service,
except as expressly set forth in the Terms of Use. You further
acknowledge that third parties may own right, title and interest,
including without limitation all Intellectual Property Rights, in and
to Content indexed by Google and linked to or excerpted in the Google
Search Results, and that You shall not acquire any right, title, or
interest in or to such Content except as provided by applicable law.
2.2 Brand Feature License. For purposes of the Terms of Use, "Brand
Features" shall be defined as the trade names, trademarks, service
marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features of
each party, respectively, as secured by such party from time to time.
Google hereby grants to You a nontransferable, nonsublicenseable,
nonexclusive license during the Term to display Google's Brand Features
for the purpose of promoting or advertising that You use the Service in
accordance with this Section 2.2 and for the purpose of fulfilling Your
obligations under Section 2.3 below. You hereby grant to Google a
nontransferable, nonexclusive license during the Term to use Your Brand
Features to advertise that You are using the Service.
In using Google Brand Features, you may not:
o display a Google Brand Feature in any manner that implies a
relationship or affiliation with, sponsorship, or endorsement by
Google, other than your
involvement in the Service, or that can be reasonably interpreted to
suggest editorial content has been authored by, or represents the views
or opinions of Google or Google personnel;
o use Google Brand Features to disparage Google, its products or
services;
o display a Google Brand Feature on your site if it contains or
displays adult content or promotes illegal activities, gambling, or the
sale of tobacco or alcohol to persons under twenty-one (21) years of
age;
o have the Google logo as the largest logo on your website (except as
displayed in the Google Search Results itself);
o display a Google Brand Feature as the most prominent element on any
page of your website;
o display a Google Brand Feature in a manner that is misleading,
defamatory, infringing, libelous, disparaging, obscene or otherwise
objectionable to Google;
o display a Google Brand Feature on a site that violates any law or
regulation; or
o remove, distort or alter any element of a Google Brand Feature (this
includes squeezing, stretching, inverting, discoloring, etc.).
You understand and agree that Google has the sole discretion to
determine whether your use of Google brand features is in accordance
with the above restrictions.
Except as set forth in this Section 2.2, nothing in the Terms of Use
shall grant or shall be deemed to grant to one party any right, title
or interest in or to the other party's Brand Features. All use by You
of Google's Brand Features (including any goodwill associated
therewith) shall inure to the benefit of Google. At no time during or
after the Term shall You challenge or assist others to challenge the
Brand Features of Google (except to the extent such restriction is
prohibited by law) or the registration thereof by Google, nor shall You
attempt to register any Brand Features (including domain names) that
are confusingly similar in any way (including but not limited to,
sound, appearance and spelling) to those of Google.
2.3 Attribution. The Google Search Results provided to You through the
Service may contain the trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos,
domain names, and other distinctive brand features of Google, its
partners, or other third party rights holders of content indexed by
Google. You may not delete or in any manner alter these trade names,
trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive
brand features.
You agree to include and display the "powered by Google" attribution
adjacent to the Service search box. If you use the standard search
control, or the standard search control form, this attribution will be
included automatically. If you use a search form of your own design, or
have no search form, you agree to place the attribution conspicuously
on the page, in close proximity to the search results, as described in
the documentation.
For all Search Results available through the Service, Google provides
Google AJAX Search API attribution language (such as "clipped from
Google - date" or such similar language as may be used from time to
time). You agree to include this attribution, unmodified, adjacent to
Search Results on your site. Google will provide this attribution
information automatically when you use the default search control, in
which case you agree not to modify or obscure this automatically
generated attribution. If you do not use the default search control,
you must include, adjacent to the Search Result and visible on the same
screen, similar attribution that indicates the Search Result came from
Google and on what date it was clipped.
For business listings Search Results from the Google Maps service,
Google sometimes provides business listing source attribution
information (such as "Business listings provided by name"). If Google
provides this attribution, then you must include it adjacent to any
business listing Search Results on your site. Google will provide this
attribution automatically when you use the default search control. If
you do not use the default search control, you must obtain and include
the business listing attribution information as
described in our documentation. Your use of third party business
listing content may also be subject to additional terms that can be
found on our Legal Notices page.
2.4 Content Removal. It is Google's policy to respond to notices of
alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act. For directions and more information, please see
http://www.google.com/dmca.html. As the host of Content, including
Google Search Results, posted to your site by end users, you agree to
comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or other appropriate
process for the removal of Content deemed to infringe the rights of
third parties, and to remove any Search Results upon request from
Google, and any Google AdWords listings that appear in the Search
Results upon request from Google or the Google advertiser who placed
the listing. You agree that your website will provide contact
information that rights-holders can use to contact you and request
removals.
3. Privacy Policy. Google's collection and use of personal information
is governed by Google's Privacy Policy, available at
http://www.google.com/privacy.html. You understand and agree that
Google may access, preserve, and disclose Your personal information and
the contents of Your account if required to do so by law or in a good
faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably
necessary to comply with legal process or protect the rights, property
and/or safety of Google, its affiliates or the public. Personal
information collected by Google may be stored and processed in the
United States or any other country in which Google or its agents
maintain facilities. By using the Service, You consent to any such
transfer of information outside of your country.

You agree to hold harmless and indemnify Google, and its subsidiaries,
affiliates, officers, agents, and employees, advertisers or partners,
from and against any third party claim arising from or in any way
related to your use of the Service, violation of these Terms of Use or

AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY GOODS, DATA, INFORMATION OR SERVICES
PURCHASED OR OBTAINED OR MESSAGES RECEIVED OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO
THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICE; (iii) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION
OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; (iv) STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD
PARTY ON THE SERVICE; OR (v) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE SERVICE.
7. EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR
THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OF
SECTIONS 5 AND 6 MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
8. Term and Termination.
8.1 Term. The term of the Terms of Use shall commence on the date upon
which agree to the Terms of Use and shall continue in force thereafter,
unless terminated as provided herein.
8.2 Termination. Google may change, suspend or discontinue all or any
aspect of the Service, including their availability, at any time, and
may suspend or terminate Your use of the Service at any time. This
includes, without limitation, the right to set, at Google's own
discretion and at any time, a maximum number of Google Search Results
you may access through the service without Google's prior written
consent.
In addition, either party may terminate the Terms of Use at any time,
for any reason, or for no reason including, but not limited to, if You
engage in any action that reflects poorly on Google or otherwise
disparages or devalues the Google Brand Features or Google's reputation
or goodwill. If You desire to terminate the Terms of Use, You must
remove the Service from Your Site.
8.3 Rejection of Application. Google shall have the right, in its sole
discretion, to reject any request to use the Service at any time and
for any reason, and such rejection shall render null and void the Terms
of Use between You and Google. Google shall not be liable to You for
damages of any sort resulting from its decision to reject such a
request.
8.4 Effect of Termination. Upon the termination of the Terms of Use for
any reason (i) all license rights granted herein shall terminate and
(ii) You shall immediately delete any and all Google Search Results and
Google Brand Features.
8.5 Survival. In the event of any termination or expiration of the
Terms of Use for any reason, Sections 2.1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6,
and 9 shall survive termination. Neither party shall be liable to the
other party for damages of any sort resulting solely from terminating
the Terms of Use in accordance with its terms.
8.6 Remedies. You acknowledge that Your breach of service/license
restrictions contained herein may cause irreparable harm to Google, the
extent of which would be difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, You agree
that, in addition to any other remedies to which Google may be legally
entitled, Google shall have the right to seek immediate injunctive
relief in the event of a breach of such sections by You or any of Your
officers, employees, consultants or other agents.
8.7 Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in the Terms of Use should be
construed to confer any rights to third party beneficiaries.
9. GENERAL INFORMATION
Entire Agreement. The Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement
between You and Google and govern your use of the Service, superseding
any prior agreements between You and Google. You also may be subject to
additional terms and conditions that may apply when You use or purchase
certain other Google services, affiliate services, third-party content
or third-party software.
Choice of Law and Forum. The Terms of Service and the relationship
between You and Google shall be governed by the laws of the State of
California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and
Google agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of
the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California.
Waiver and Severability of Terms. The failure of Google to exercise or
enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service shall not
constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the
Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor
to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the
provision, and the other provisions of the Terms of Service remain in
full force and effect.
Statute of Limitations. You agree that regardless of any statute or law
to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related
to use of Google services or the Terms of Service must be filed within
one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever
barred.
The section headings in the Terms of Service are for convenience only
and have no legal or contractual effect.
