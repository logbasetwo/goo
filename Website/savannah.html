<b>Ranging from solid black to spotted tabby these intelligent playful 
shorthaired cats are intensly energetic and dog-like. Savannahs are the 
largest hybrid cat today. They don't need any gromming although
they don't mind baths. They're apperance is quiet clumsy, oversize
ears, long legs but that is the exact opposite of what they are.
They have incredible jumping skills that is amusing to watch. Overall
Savannahs are bright but energentic and would be good for people with
a lot of energy.
