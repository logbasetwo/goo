Right now you don't have to feed your pet.  But soon you will. You can only get one pet becuase of that. Unlike neopets soon you will be able to own as many pets as you would like.

Balogh points are your sorce of money.  But right now Balogh points are not up and running.  If you see anything they may be working,or they may be a test.

You will not be able to buy any things.  One reason is because baloghpoints are being worked on (your money.)  Another reason is because we have no shops yet.  Thirdly we are working on making it posible to put stuff in your, your stuff.
