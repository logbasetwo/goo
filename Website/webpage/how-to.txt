Description: Use this script to add a simple image trail to your webpage. A single image follows the mouse around, and is configurable in the following ways:

    *

      Image trail can be set to disappear after x seconds (or always visible)
    *

      The trail's x and y offsets can be explicitly set. This allows you, for example, to set the trail to be further away from the mouse than by default.
    *

      Image trail automatically disappears when it's close to the document's horizontal and vertical edges, so no ugly browser scrollbars appears. 

This script works in both IE4+ and NS6+. Enjoy!

Example: Move your cursor!
