			This web database is designed to help those who want to learn programming, or those who want to refresh their memory 
			and programming skills. I am not a very experienced programmer, so I will refer to many other sources as I go along.
			Currently the languages I will spend my time on are C, C++, HTML/CSS, Java, and Python. If you are new to programming,
			feel free to look around at any of the pages. However, I suggest you start by learning Python. Python is a remarkably 
			powerful dynamic programming language that is used in a wide variety of application domains. This is a very easy language
			for beginners that have never programmed before. If you are specifically interested in website design, check out the HTML
			section. HyperText Markup Language is the main language used for creating web pages and other information that can be 
			displayed in a web browser. Cascading Style Sheets modify a markup language in look and format. Currently I have not uploaded
			a lot of information, but keep checking back, as I will continue to work on this for a while. Feel free to shoot me an email
			if you have any questions or think anything should be changed. Just remember, you can usually Google it!
