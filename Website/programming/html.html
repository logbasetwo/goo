<h1>How to make your own website.</h1>

If you want to make your own website, and don't know where to start, you are in the right place. There are currently 
many different approaches to making a website. You could make it using Google Sites, Webs.com, or even Simple Site. 
There are many other ways to easily create a free website that can be edited in seconds and takes little effort. However, 
you still have to remember a long URL that is hosted under that companies servers and DNS
 (Domain Name System). Although this is okay for some people, other people find it frustrating. And if a web provider 
 decides to change the layout of their program, it can be difficult to change what you want to change. But what are they 
 really doing to make your website for you? After you put in the inputs you want  on your website, a program translates 
 that into HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) code which is then compiled by your web browser. You then view this web page 
 and interact with it, using this HTML code. If you know how to write HTML code, you can skip the web service and make your 
 website the way you want it, and that will never change. This section of Goo$ will teach you the ins and outs of HTML 
 programming. But don't worry, it is really easy! HTML is practically english, so you won't have to learn a whole lot of new 
 terms. Most of it comes with practice and problem solving, but it doesn't take much to get started. And if you are ever 
 wondering about something, just Google it! There are many people who have probably had the same questions and have already 
 posted it on a forum. There are also many other online tutorials like this. Feel free to check them out. This entire website 
 was made by this approach. The classic goo.centreweb.net was created by me as a first grader! And I found this to be very 
 easy, even as a six year old.

Let's start with the very basics. Getting started is quite easy. If you are using Windows, open up a blank notepad. Later on you 
may want to get a more complex program, but for now this will do. If you are using Mac OS X, open up Text Edit. I will mostly 
refer to things the way they are in Windows, but occasionally I will mention Mac. I am also assuming that if you are using Linux 
that you probably know enough to get into an ide editor, or a text editor like gedit. I would suggest Geany, Eclipse, or Codeblocks 
for anyone using Linux. Follow the instructions for your operating system to get started below:

	Windows:
	<p>
	Open up Notepad, and click File, then Save As... Then click on the drop-down window and select "All Files". Change the file name 
	to "test.html".
	</td>
	<td>
	Mac OS X:
	<p>
	Although I have little experience with using this, I think that this will work. Go to Preferences and check "Ignore rich text commands
	in HTML files". Then much like in Windows, click File, then Save as, and change the file name to "test.html".
	</td>
	<td>
	Linux:
	<p>
	As said in the intro, this probably is pretty easy to figure out if you have already discovered Linux. I would suggest to start 
	right away with an IDE, which I will mention several for Mac and Windows. But for Linux I personally use Geany, but think that Codeblocks
	is fine. I would stay away from Eclipse, as this is an outdated IDE, but it still works for most things. When you save your first file, save
	it as test.html. The IDE should figure it out. If you are having trouble getting these programs, go into your software management program, assuming
	you have one, and search for programming, or IDE.
