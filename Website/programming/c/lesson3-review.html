<h3>Key Questions</h3>
In the key questions page for each lesson there will be some questions usually asking you to program something. This will help you 
review what you have learned so far. Answers are not usually provided unless the question is a trivia question. It is up to you to 
try to answer the question or make the program following the parameters given to you. This is the most realistic way to test your 
ability of the language as this would be how a job would work. You never have to look at these questions and there is nowhere to input answers. Good luck!
