So what exactly did your program do? The first line of your program is including a header file:
<p>
<pre>
	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</pre>
 This file has all the necessary information to use the commands used in this program. STDIO stands for Standard Input/Output. 
 Chances are you will include this in every c program. The next line is left blank. It does not need to bee blank, and as many lines 
 as pleases you could be entered. Unlike python, where whitespace is important, whitespace does not matter. That means that all 
 spaces and carriage returns are ignored. Before the program is compiled, it is run through preprocessing. This takes all comments 
 and whitespace out of the code so that it can just focus on the content of the program. We will talk about comments later in this 
 lesson.
 <p>
<pre>
	int main(){
</pre>
 The next line is ignored by the preprocessor but is noted by the compiler. The compiler notes that it is a function that returns an integer.
 If you have looked at my <a href="../html-css.html">HTML and CSS</a> section of my website, you can think of this as the body of the program.
 All commands will be within this section or referenced in this section.
 <p>
<pre>
	printf("Hello World");
</pre>
 This line is taking the print function from the standard input output header (printf) and using it to display the words <b>Hello World</b> to 
 the screen. You can replace <b>Hello World</b> With anything, and it will display it on the screen. The semicolon at the end is 
 very important. This tells the compiler that it is a statement, telling the program to do something when it is run. Without this 
 semi-colon, the compiler will not know what this line of code does and will return an error.
 <p>
<pre>
	return(0);
</pre>
Remember that I said the <b>int main()</b> function returned an integer? Here it is. This is telling the compiler that the function is complete.
All functions return something. This is one function you will always have. You can always have it return a different number, but the program 
will not exit cleanly. I suggest always returning a zero at the end of your program because that is what is usally expected. A 
semicolon is present again telling the compiler that this is a statement.
<pre>
	}
</pre>
Code::Blocks should put this closing bracket in by default when every you type an opening bracket({). It will do the same thing for 
parenthesis and sqaure brackets ([]). This is containing the contents of <b>int main</b> If you type your instructions out of 
<b>int main()</b> your debugger will give you an error. So now that you know how your program works, let's teach it to someone else!
When writing a program, it is good to get in the habit of writing comments. This helps someone who did not write the program themselves 
to understnad it. In C, comments can either be written with a double slash (//) or can be contained with an opening (/*) and a closing
(*/). Some examples of comments are displayed below:
<p>
<pre>
	//This is a comment
	
	/* This is also a comment,
	which can be displayed on multiple
	lines */
</pre>
As I said earlier, the preprocessor takes comments out just like whitespace, so comments will not be run in the program.
<p>
<pre>
	/* Program that displays the words Hello World to the screen */
	
	#include <stdio.h> //Includes the Standard Input Output Header File
	
	int main() //Main function that is used in all programs and returns an integer
	{
		printf("Hello World"); //Prints Hello World to the Console
		return(0); //Returns and integer ending the program
	}
</pre>
That is how I would add comments to this program. Now that you are done with this lesson, you can review your first key questions!
