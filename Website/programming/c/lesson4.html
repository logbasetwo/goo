I'm hoping you tried printing multiple lines when looking at the key questions for the last lesson. You probably tried something like this:
<p>
<pre>
	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
	
	int main(){
		printf("I am printing this statement ");
		printf("on two lines.");
		return(0);
	}
</pre>
This however would output:
<p>
<pre>
	I am printing this statement on two lines.
</pre>
What you need is to tell the program that the next statement is on a new line. You could technically write a program like this:
<p>
<pre>
	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; intmain(){ printf("I am printing this statement "); printf("on two lines."); return(0); }
</pre>
... but I wouldn't recommend it. To tell the program to print on a new line you can insert a \n at the end of your statement within the quotes.
<p>
<pre>
	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
	
	int main(){
		printf("I am printing this statement \n");
		printf("on two lines.");
		return(0);
	}
</pre>
\n is acting like a character. \ is not printed to the screen and the combination of \n prints a new line. If you wanted to print quotes within a print statement, you would have to make sure the compiler new you were not ending the statement with those quotes. To do this you would type <b>\"</b>. The output of the above program would now be:
<p>
<pre>
	I am printing this statement 
	on two lines.
</pre>
<p>
To go through these lessons, you should probably have a basic understanding of Algebra. That will make this next part of the lesson much easier. In Algebra you have variables which stand for a specific value or any possible value that works in the equation they are in. Variable work exactly the same in programming.
<p>
<pre>
	int x = 10;
</pre>
This statement is assigning the value 10 to the integer <i>x</i>.X can now be used later in the program. If you wanted to print the value of x, your entire program would look like this:
<p>
<pre>
	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
	
	int main(){
		int x = 10;
		printf("%d", x);
		return(0);
	}
</pre>
Notice that there are no quotes around the variable <i>x</i>. Instead there is %d within the quotes. This tells the compiler to display a digit to the screen. After the end quote is placed in, it uses the variable to place in the digit. If we just printed x in quotes the output would be:
<p>
<pre>
	x
</pre>
The output of our program is rather:
<p>
<pre>
	10
</pre>
Variables can be modified just like in mathematics:
<p>
<pre>
	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
	
	int main(){
		int x = 5 + 3 * 7;
		printf("%d", x);
		return(0);
	}
</pre>
Here the output would be 15. Order of operations is kept. Multiplication and division are calculated first and then addition and subtraction. If we wanted the calculation to be 5 + 3 and that * 7, we could change it by adding in parentheses. 
<p>
<pre>
	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
	
	int main(){
		int x = (5 + 3) * 7;
		printf("%d", x);
		return(0);
	}
</pre>
Now the output would be 56.
<p>
Variable names can be virutally anything but have some rules:
<p class="extra"></p>
<pre>
	* Variable names should not be more than 31 characters in length (And this would also be a pain to type out each time. Keep it short!)
	
	* No commas, spaces or special symbols other than an underscore are allowed in the variable name.
	
	* The first character of the variable name must either be a letter or underscore. It should not start with the digit.
	
	* Variable names CAN CONTAIN capital letters.
</pre>
<p class="extra">
</p>
What happens if you assign a different value to a variable later in a program?
<p>
<pre>
	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
	
	int main(){
		int x = 10;
		printf("%d \n", x);
		x = 6;
		printf("%d", x);
		return(0);
	}
</pre>
Here 10 would be printed and then 6 would be printed on a new line. Notice I did not declare what variable type x was the second time. If I did, I would be calling two different variables with the same name. This is not allowed in ANSI-C (The type of the C language we are programming in.) If we put in the following code, 6 would be printed to the screen, because the value has been changed. The original value is not used:
<p>
<pre>
	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
	
	int main(){
		int x = 10;
		x = 6;
		printf("%d", x);
		return(0);
	}
</pre>
There is much more we can do with variables, but we will revisit them in another section.
