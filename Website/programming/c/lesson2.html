Although it is possible to program in a text editor, it can be quite a pain. Trying to use the command line for the first time could 
have also been daunting in the last lesson. Good news, this isn't how most programmers develop software. An easier way to write, 
compile and run code is within an integrated development environment (IDE). An IDE contains all the necessary tools to program without 
having to open up a command line interface. For these lessons I will be using <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/">Code::Blocks.</a> 
I would suggest downloading this because it is the easiest way to get started on programming in the c language. Code::Blocks is open 
source and works on virtually any operating system. <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/binaries">Download it here.</a>
<p>
Once you have downloaded it, open it in your downloads folder and follow the instructions to install. I suggest leaving everything 
to its default settings. Once it is open it should look very similar to this:
<center><img src="codeblocks1.jpg" height="600px" width="800px"></center>
<p>
Close the <b>Start here</b> tab. Click <b>File</b> then hover over <b>New</b>. Select the <b>Empty File</b> option. Type in the code 
we made last time. If you don't remember I have provided it below:
<p>
<pre>
	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
	
	int main()
	{
		printf("Hello World");
		return(0);
	}
</pre>
Now click <b>File</b> then <b>Save File As</b> and choose where you want your file to be saved to and name it. Remember to include 
the <b>.c</b> extension. You should notice that colors have been added to each element of the program. This will make longer programs 
easier to read.

</p>
At this point, you could click Build then Compile and then Run from the Build tab in the menu, but it is just easier if you hit F9. 
This will do all three tasks at once. A terminal interface should pop up with the words <b>Hello World</b> displayed. And that's it!
We'll talk about how this program works in the next section. <a href="lesson3.html">Click here to go to the next lesson.</a>
