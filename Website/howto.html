This is rily how to make a web site.There is a html referince that talls the computer wate it needs to do. You can also put pictures on your web site I put cheetahs on my cheetah page. 
<p>
When you went to put a space some place in your web page.Then you put one of these and tipe  p and then put one of these. And there you go.

<br>
You can do a www. web page. The first W stands for world. The next 2 stand for wide and web. I said it in order. 




<p>
If you use a &lt; and a command, then a &gt; to end it...
<p>
For example, here is how you center things
<pre>
&lt;center&gt;This is centered.&lt;/center&gt;
</pre>
shows up like this
<br>
<center>This is centered.</center>


<table width="100%" border="0">
 <tr>
  <td align="center"><<<</td>
  <td align="center">>>></td>
 </tr>
</table>
<hr>
This is how you make a link.

<br>
Start with the "<tt>a</tt>" command like this:
<br>
<tt><font color="blue"><b>&lt;a </b></font></tt>
<br>
then add a hypertext reference command:
<br>
<tt>&lt;a <font color="blue"><b>href="</b></font></tt>
<br>
then put in the web page address you want:
<br>
<tt>&lt;a href="<font color="blue"><b>http://www.google.com/</b></font></tt>
<br>
(don't forget the "<tt><b>http://</b></tt>" part)
<br>
and finish that part of the command:
<br>
<tt>&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/<font color="blue"><b>"&gt;</b></font></tt>
<br>
Now you have to decide what text to show in the link:
<br>
<tt>&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/"&gt;<font color="blue"><b>Some Text link!</b></font></tt>
<br>
and then finish the command by turning off the "<tt>a</tt>" part:
<br>
<tt>&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/"&gt;Some Text link!<font color="blue"><b>&lt;/a&gt;</b></font></tt>
<p>
This is what it looks like when it is done:
<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/">Some Text link!</a>
<p>
That's it.
