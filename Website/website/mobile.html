	<h4>New Look!</h4>
          <p>We are using CSS styling to make our website look more sleek and modern. We are starting with a basis off of bootstrap. Click 
		<a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">here</a> to learn more about it.</p> Along with this styling, we are calling ourselves Goo2. 
		If you want to see the old Goo. Click on <a href="index-goo.html">archives</a>.

	<h4>Peabody</h4>
          <p>We will soon have a section of our website devoted to the Peabody Club. We do not have anything currently, but will be working on this soon.
		Don't worry if you're not a member, because you will be able to sign up online once this is up.

	  <b>
	  UPDATE: There is now a page for the Peabody Club, but there really is nothing of interest. If you are currently a member of the peabody club, you
	  may want to try it out.
